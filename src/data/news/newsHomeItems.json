            "For nearly two decades, Ioannis Tarnanas, the founder and chief scientific officer at Altoida, has been dedicated to developing virtual and augmented reality tools aimed at providing early predictions of mental illnesses in elderly patients.",
            "Altoida's technology, cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the technology was approved), is designed to predict the onset of Alzheimer's by assessing brain function. Remarkably, it boasts an impressive 94% accuracy rate in identifying individuals who may develop the disease six to ten years before the onset of mild cognitive impairment symptoms.",
            "Alzheimer's and other dementia-related costs in the U.S. are projected to reach nearly $290 billion in 2019 and could surge as high as $1.1 trillion by 2050, according to Altoida's estimates. However, Altoida believes that these costs can be mitigated through early detection.",
            "Altoida's innovative approach utilizes an iPad or tablet equipped with accelerometers, gyroscopes, and touch screen sensors to detect subtle 'micro-errors' as patients engage in a series of augmented and virtual reality challenges. It's essentially a game where patients place virtual objects in different physical settings within a clinical environment and then attempt to retrieve them. Presently, Altoida's technology is available only under clinical supervision within a medical office, but the company is exploring ways to bring its diagnostic tools into the home environment. Tarnanas initiated longitudinal clinical trials on cognitive testing in the early 2000s while pursuing his Master's at the University of Sussex.",
            "Dr. Walter Greenleaf, PhD, a neuroscientist and Distinguished Visiting Scholar working at the Stanford University Virtual Human Interaction Lab, highlights the importance of enhancing methods to objectively assess cognitive function. He notes that this is a crucial component of the next generation of digital medicine, essential for advancing research in neurodegenerative diseases and improving clinical interventions.",
            "Altoida has already garnered support from influential healthcare investors, securing $6.3 million in a new funding round led by M Ventures, the corporate investment arm of pharmaceutical giant Merck. Additional participation comes from Grey Sky Venture Partners, VI Partners AG, Alpana Ventures, and FYRFLY Venture Partners.",
            "The beauty of active digital biomarkers is that they can expand to cover more conditions, says Tarnanas. The company is considering expanding its prognostic toolkit to assess long-term effects of traumatic brain injuries and post-operative cognitive disorders.",
            "Jonathan L. Liss, MD, director at Columbus Memory Center and Founder of Columbus Memory Project, who has been using Altoida's technology since September 2018, emphasizes the significance of early detection. He applauds the Altoida Neuro-Motor Index (NMI) device as a smart way to identify early-stage disease and monitor its progression without the need for lengthy cognitive tests, tissue samples, or radiological interventions. It represents a welcome advancement in cognitive health.",
            "Altoida is not the sole player in the quest to diagnose Alzheimer's at an earlier stage. Recently, New York-based company MyndYou announced a partnership with Mizuho to introduce its passive prognostic toolkit to Japan, backed by approximately $2 million in funding to develop its own solution.",
            "Ioannis Tarnanas, the visionary founder and chief scientific officer at Altoida, has dedicated nearly two decades to pioneering virtual and augmented reality tools designed to predict the onset of mental illnesses in elderly patients.",
            "Altoida's groundbreaking technology, cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is a game-changer in predicting Alzheimer's disease. With an astounding 94% accuracy rate, it can identify individuals at risk of developing the disease six to ten years before mild cognitive impairment symptoms appear.",
            "The economic burden of Alzheimer's and dementia-related costs in the U.S. is projected to skyrocket to nearly $290 billion in 2019 and could potentially reach a staggering $1.1 trillion by 2050. Altoida firmly believes that early detection is the key to mitigating these escalating costs.",
            "Altoida's innovative approach involves using an iPad or tablet equipped with accelerometers, gyroscopes, and touch screen sensors to detect subtle 'micro-errors' as patients engage in augmented and virtual reality challenges. It's like a game where patients interact with virtual objects in various physical settings within a clinical environment. While currently available only under clinical supervision, Altoida is exploring ways to bring its diagnostic tools into the home environment.",

He shared that he ventured off the traditional academic cardiology path approximately three years ago, driven by his deep fascination with the potential of digital health in the realm of heart care. Wessler emphasised that the current methods of delivering cardiovascular care have seen minimal change. While the existing model is effective to a large extent, there is ample room for improvement.",
            "\"In the past seven years or so, we've entered a new era where we've made significant progress in treating people once they become ill,\" he stated. \"However, we're falling short in keeping them healthy.\" To address this gap, Heartbeat Health has introduced what Wessler refers to as a \"digital-first\" layer. This innovative approach enables patients to engage with experts through telemedicine, who can then guide them to the appropriate in-person care provider—potentially a \"preferred Heartbeat partner\" or another qualified specialist.",
            "This initial interaction serves to eliminate inefficiencies, ensuring patients are directed to the right place from the start and receive evidence-based, guideline-based testing, rather than relying solely on the individual practice habits of various physicians. Furthermore, Heartbeat Health strives to centralise a patient's relevant heart data, which may originate from wearable consumer devices like an Apple Watch or Fitbit. The platform also monitors and analyses the effectiveness of different treatments.",
            "\"Our ultimate goal is to provide the software and technology to power it all while leaving no patient behind at the outset,\" Wessler emphasised.",
            "He added that the program is compatible with most commercial insurance plans and has already made a substantial impact on the care of over 10,000 patients in the New York area. Cardiologists have welcomed the platform, seeing it as a unifying force in an otherwise fragmented system, provided it complements their work.",
            "With healthcare's primary focus squarely on the relentless challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it's crucial not to lose sight of the persistent and pressing health issues that continue to afflict our communities. One such concern is the enduring threat of heart disease, which maintains its status as the leading cause of death in the United States.",
            "Heartbeat Health, a trailblazing startup, has set its sights on revolutionizing the landscape of cardiovascular care. In a groundbreaking announcement, the company proudly reveals the successful completion of a Series A funding round, securing an impressive $8.2 million in investments.",

        "description": "A 17-year dry spell in the realm of Alzheimer's drugs came to an end…",
        "content": [
            "A 17-year dry spell in the realm of Alzheimer's drugs came to an end as the FDA granted approval to Biogen's Aduhelm (aducanumab). The FDA's decision was shrouded in controversy, but it appears to have ignited interest among drug developers who are now focusing their efforts on combating this degenerative brain disease.",
            "In essence, the approval of Aduhelm followed a convoluted path with conflicting results from clinical trials. In November 2020, an independent FDA advisory board recommended against endorsing the drug. However, in June, the agency proceeded with its approval under the Accelerated Approval Program.",
            "Aduhelm is now the first innovative treatment targeting a fundamental factor in Alzheimer's: the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. The drug garnered support from patient and industry groups (the FDA cited the \"urgent need for treatment\" in its statement explaining the decision). Nevertheless, several doctors have expressed reservations. One member of the expert committee that initially voted against Aduhelm's approval in November has since resigned.",
            "However, the scientific uncertainty and the highly publicised debate surrounding Aduhelm's approval haven't dampened enthusiasm within the pharmaceutical industry. Instead, it may herald a wave of forthcoming treatments in the coming years, capitalising on Aduhelm's approval, however contentious it may be. \"This is promising news for investors and drug companies working on novel treatments,\" states Alison Ward, a research scientist at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.",
            "Historically, several factors have made developing Alzheimer's drugs a formidable challenge. Firstly, there is a 17-year history of clinical trial failures. Even Biogen's clinical trials for Aduhelm faced setbacks in 2019 when it was unclear if they would meet their clinical endpoints—effectively, the desired trial outcomes. Notably, Aduhelm gained approval based on a \"surrogate endpoint,\" the reduction of beta-amyloid, rather than the primary endpoint, cognitive function.",
            "Alzheimer's drug trials have also been historically costly. A 2018 paper in Alzheimer's and Dementia: Translational Research and Clinical Interventions estimated the cost of developing an Alzheimer's drug to be around $5.6 billion. By comparison, the mean investment needed to bring a new drug to market is approximately $1.3 billion, according to an analysis of SEC filings for FDA-approved drugs between 2009 and 2018 (although the median cost was roughly $985 million). Earlier estimates placed the cost of bringing a drug to market at $2.8 billion.",
            "While Phase 3 trials for Alzheimer's drugs are still primarily sponsored by the industry, there has been a shift over the past five years. Government grants and funding through public-private partnerships have played an increasingly substantial role in funding these endeavours.",
            "The approval of Aduhelm has not only raised hope for Alzheimer's patients and their families but has also reignited interest in Alzheimer's research. Many pharmaceutical companies and research institutions are now accelerating their efforts to develop innovative treatments for the disease.",
            "Aduhelm's approval marks a significant shift in Alzheimer's drug development. For years, researchers struggled to find effective treatments that could target the underlying causes of the disease. Aduhelm's focus on beta-amyloid plaques represents a breakthrough in this regard.",
            "Despite the controversies surrounding Aduhelm's approval, it's important to acknowledge the dedication of scientists and researchers who have tirelessly worked to advance our understanding of Alzheimer's. Their commitment to finding a cure remains unwavering.",
            "The path to treating Alzheimer's remains challenging, but recent developments have injected fresh optimism into the field. As we continue to learn more about the complexities of the disease, there's hope that more effective treatments will emerge in the near future.",
            "In addition to drug development, Alzheimer's research encompasses a broad range of studies, from understanding genetic risk factors to exploring lifestyle interventions that may reduce the risk of cognitive decline. The collaborative efforts of scientists worldwide contribute to our growing knowledge of Alzheimer's disease.",
            "One of the key lessons from the Aduhelm story is the importance of rigorous clinical trials and transparent evaluation processes. While the drug's approval was met with debate, it highlights the critical role that regulatory agencies play in evaluating the safety and efficacy of new treatments.",
            "Ultimately, the fight against Alzheimer's is a multifaceted endeavor that requires the collective efforts of researchers, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the pharmaceutical industry. The road ahead may still be challenging, but progress is being made, offering hope to millions affected by this devastating disease."

            "In the intricate realm of healthcare, where complexities often leave consumers frustrated, lies a substantial opportunity for significant improvements through seemingly straightforward approaches. Halo Diagnostics, known as Halo Dx, has successfully raised $19 million in a Series A funding round. Their mission is to elevate the diagnosis of various severe illnesses by harmonising data from multiple tests and ensuring easy accessibility for healthcare providers. Moreover, they've taken the unconventional step of securing an eight-figure line of credit to acquire the medical facilities essential for achieving this vision.",
            "Anyone who has navigated major health concerns understands that the quality of care varies widely among providers. Factors such as insurance coverage and the methods adopted by healthcare providers play a pivotal role in this disparity.",
            "For example, in the case of men seeking prostate cancer screenings, the conventional bloodwork and rectal exams have remained largely unchanged for years and aren't highly effective in predicting problems. This often results in uncertainty and unnecessary procedures like biopsies.",
            "Fortunately, some providers offer multiparametric MRIs, which significantly enhance problem detection. Combining an MRI with a urine test that checks for genetic markers increases the accuracy of detection to near certainty levels. However, these advanced tests are more costly and require specialised facilities and personnel, often not aligning with a provider's existing infrastructure. Halo Dx aims to address this challenge by reimagining the medical data flow to accommodate multifactor diagnosis.",
            "Brian Axe, co-founder, and chief product officer at Halo Dx, commented on the existing healthcare scenario, stating, \"Doctors and imaging centres, in general, are not offering the latest level of care. If you're fortunate, you might receive it, but in community medicine, it's unlikely.\"",
            "One additional challenge is that medical imaging or testing providers typically don't venture into multi-modal testing on their own. Acquiring and setting up testing facilities is expensive and complex, requiring expertise to manage and integrate the results.",
            "To overcome these obstacles, Halo Dx is investing tens of millions of dollars and acquiring imaging and testing centres themselves (currently totaling four). They are taking charge of these operations and combining them with other tests.",
            "\"The imaging orders are already coming in, and the centres are profitable. They're joining us because they recognize how technology is poised to disrupt their industry, and they want to be a part of driving this change,\" noted Axe.",
            "Initially targeting prostate and breast cancers, the integration of more and better data is poised to enhance the diagnosis and treatment planning for various other conditions, including but not limited to Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases (still under validation).",
            "By running multiple intake, imaging, and testing facilities under one company and integrating the results, Halo Dx aims to make it more attractive for healthcare providers to participate. Furthermore, they are applying enterprise-grade software expertise to address the longstanding challenges of medical data storage and communication—a neglected aspect of the field.",
            "Axe compared Halo Dx's approach to that of One Medical—streamlining processes to enhance efficiency, thereby simplifying the consumer-provider relationship and encouraging more interactions.",
            "While it may seem like a daring move, taking on nearly a hundred million dollars in obligations and entering a highly complex and regulated sector, Halo Dx's experienced team, notable backers, substantial growth potential, and the success stories of healthcare innovators like One Medical have likely emboldened their resolve.",
            "Zola Global Investors led this funding round, with prominent figures from the medical and tech sectors, including Anne Wojcicki, Fred Moll, Stephen Pomeranz, Bob Reed, Robert Ciardi, Jim Pallotta, and even Ronnie Lott of 49ers fame, expressing their confidence in Halo Dx's model and approach to advancing and expanding healthcare."

        "description": "While studying medicine at UC San Francisco, Dereck Paul…",
        "content": [
            "While studying medicine at UC San Francisco, Dereck Paul became increasingly concerned about the lack of innovation in medical software compared to other sectors such as finance and aerospace. He believed that patients would benefit most from doctors equipped with cutting-edge tech, inspiring him to create a company prioritising the needs of patients and doctors over hospital administrators or insurance companies.",
            "In 2021, Paul partnered with his friend Graham Ramsey, an engineer at Modern Fertility, a women's health tech company, to co-found Glass Health. This innovative platform provides physicians with a notebook to store, organise, and share their diagnostic and treatment approaches throughout their careers. Ramsey describes it as a \"personal knowledge management system\" for medical learning and practice.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic placed tremendous burdens on the healthcare system, exacerbating healthcare provider burnout. Paul, who had experienced provider burnout firsthand during his medical training, felt compelled to leverage technology to enhance medical practice. This shared empathy for frontline healthcare providers led to the creation of Glass Health.",
            "Glass Health initially gained traction on social media, particularly X (formerly Twitter), among physicians, nurses, and medical trainees. This online engagement translated into the company's first funding round, a $1.5 million pre-seed investment led by Breyer Capital in 2022. Subsequently, Glass Health was accepted into Y Combinator's Winter 2023 batch. Earlier this year, Paul and Ramsey made the strategic decision to pivot the company towards generative AI, aligning with this growing trend.",
            "Today, Glass Health offers an AI-powered tool driven by a large language model (LLM), akin to OpenAI's ChatGPT. This tool generates diagnoses and evidence-based treatment options based on input from physicians. Clinicians can input patient descriptions, and Glass Health's AI provides likely prognoses and clinical plans.",
            "Paul explains, \"Clinicians enter a patient summary, also known as a problem representation, that describes the relevant demographics, past medical history, signs and symptoms, and descriptions of laboratory and radiology findings related to a patient's presentation. Glass analyzes the patient summary and recommends five to ten diagnoses that the clinician may want to consider and further investigate.\"",
            "Furthermore, Glass Health can draft a case assessment paragraph for clinicians to review, including explanations about potentially relevant diagnostic studies. These explanations can be edited and incorporated into clinical notes or shared within the Glass Health community.",
            "In theory, Glass Health's tool appears incredibly useful, but it's important to note that even advanced LLMs have shown limitations in providing health advice. Several instances of AI-driven health tools providing inaccurate or harmful information have raised concerns.",
            "Paul acknowledges these concerns and emphasises that Glass Health's AI should not be interpreted as definitive or prescriptive in its responses. This cautious approach likely stems from the potential legal scrutiny and regulatory implications that a more definitive AI tool could face.",
            "Paul also addresses concerns about bias in AI, particularly in healthcare. Since medical LLMs are often trained on health records, they may have blind spots and biases. However, Paul asserts that Glass Health connects LLMs with clinical guidelines created and peer-reviewed by its academic physician team, which includes members from major academic medical centres across the country. He stresses that clinicians must supervise the AI's outputs and use them as recommendations, emphasising the AI's role as an assistant rather than a replacement for clinical judgement.",
            "Despite these challenges, Glass Health's innovative approach has found early adopters. The platform has attracted over 59,000 users and offers a direct-to-clinician subscription. This year, Glass Health plans to pilot an enterprise offering integrated with electronic health records, complying with HIPAA regulations. Fifteen health systems and companies are on the waitlist to explore this offering.",
            "With $6.5 million in funding, Glass Health will focus on physician-led creation and review of clinical guidelines, AI fine-tuning, and general research and development. The company is well-positioned to make a significant impact on medical diagnosis and treatment planning, with a four-year runway to continue its mission."

            "Houston-based startup BrainCheck has successfully secured $3 million in seed funding to further develop its pioneering app designed to assist users in assessing brain health. The app achieves this by engaging users in interactive games on an iPad. BrainCheck's journey began in 2014 when it was founded by Dr. David Eagleman, a prominent neuroscientist associated with Baylor College of Medicine. The company has transformed the conventional neuropsychological and neurological assessments into a digital format for easy accessibility and convenience.",
            "Unlike traditional concussion assessments administered by neuropsychologists and neurologists offline, BrainCheck transforms these assessments into an interactive digital format. It provides a user-friendly way for individuals to understand if they or a loved one may have experienced a concussion.",
            "While concussions have often been associated with professional athletes, they are not limited to this group. In the United States alone, there are 1.6 million to 3.8 million sport-related concussions, also known as mild traumatic brain injuries, each year. This significant public health concern has gained increasing attention, with the introduction of laws like Washington state's Zackery Lystedt Law in 2009, aimed at managing head injuries in youth sports.",
            "The 2017 presidential budget proposal sought $5 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish a National Concussion Surveillance System. Such a system would enable more accurate tracking of how mild traumatic brain injuries impact the U.S. population. BrainCheck's data can play a role in enhancing our understanding of neurocognitive health.",
            "While BrainCheck initially gained traction in the U.S. by selling its app to school districts, athletic trainers, and families of sports enthusiasts, the company is now eyeing international expansion. Beyond concussion monitoring, BrainCheck is actively developing features to assess older users at risk of dementia.",
            "BrainCheck's significance extends beyond concussions and dementia assessment. It could be used to study the side effects and safety of drugs, polypharmacy, and other factors affecting memory and coordination.",
            "Rather than venturing into new digital technology sectors, such as virtual reality, BrainCheck's focus is on optimising its mobile platform's capabilities. Although the app currently serves as a health tracking tool and isn't classified as a diagnostic clinical device, BrainCheck intends to work closely with the FDA to attain class 2 medical device status. This would further enhance its credibility and utility in healthcare.",
            "Dr. David Eagleman emphasises the app's role in making a positive impact on families. Many individuals tend to avoid seeking medical attention for cognitive issues until it's too late.
